The major points of this setup would be:

--Allowing you to debug with console.log();
--Prefer using const over let or var, as well as disallow var;
--Disapproving of variables with the same name in callbacks;
--Requiring single quotes over double quotes;
--Requiring semicolons. While it's not required in JavaScript, it's considered one of the     most common best practices to follow;
--Requiring accessing properties to be on the same line;
--Requiring indenting to be done with tabs;
--Limiting nested callbacks to 4. If you hit this error, it is a good idea to consider --refactoring your code.
